Two Abilities: Physical, and Mental

These two stats are you base score of any Non-Proficient/Unknown skill attempts. 

  Examples: 
  Bob needs to cut down a tree; having never done this before he will roll with his base Physical Modifier of +1. As he is untrained, non-proficient, and never cut down a tree before he can not influence the process outside of his Physical Abilities to hack down the tree. Small tree so Diff Check of 10, Bob rolls a 9 so he succeeds with the addition of his modifier, but unfortunately the tree has fallen on a house.... 

  Sylivia has been tasked with leading a Prayer to Heracule. As Sylivia is a mage her devotions have been devoid of religious influence and training but her high Mental Modifier will surely help in the task at hand.  Heracule is a common god and as such the Prayer Diff will be set at 8; Sylivia rolling a 12, adding her +2 Modifier makes it look as if she is a devout follower of Heracule.

Base abilities are determined by rolling 3d6 and re-rolling 1s and 2s.  This will put you in nomral to exceptional ranges but not at the extreme ends of the ranges.  1-5 = Weak/Simple, 6-10 = Normal, 11-15 = Gifted, 16-20 = Exceptional

There is no ability score above 20 nor below 1 with out magical/devine/traumatic interaction.

There is also not permanent scores above 20 nor below 1, only temporary. 





The variety and spice of the game will fall on the Story Teller in giving entertaining outcomes of critical success, or miserable fumbles. There is also the ability to add value to close call successes and verbosity to 'normal' success.
